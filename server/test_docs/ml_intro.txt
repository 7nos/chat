Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. It enables computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with environment
4. Deep Learning: Using neural networks with multiple layers

Applications:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Fraud Detection

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
