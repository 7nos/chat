Embedded Systems Basics

An embedded system is a computer system designed to perform specific tasks within a larger system. These systems are found in many devices we use daily.

Key Components:
1. Microcontroller - The brain of the system
2. Memory - Stores program and data
3. Input/Output - Connects to sensors and actuators
4. Communication - Allows data exchange with other devices

Common Applications:
- Smartphones
- Cars
- Medical devices
- Home appliances
- Industrial machines
- IoT devices

Communication Protocols:
- UART for serial communication
- SPI for high-speed data transfer
- I2C for connecting multiple devices
- CAN for automotive systems

Development Tools:
- IDEs for coding
- Debuggers for testing
- Oscilloscopes for signal analysis
- Logic analyzers for protocol debugging
