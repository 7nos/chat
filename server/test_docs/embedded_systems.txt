Embedded Systems Fundamentals

Embedded systems are specialized computing systems designed to perform specific tasks within larger mechanical or electrical systems. They are typically resource-constrained and require real-time operation.

Key Components:
1. Microcontroller/Microprocessor
   - CPU core (e.g., ARM Cortex-M)
   - Memory (RAM, ROM, Flash)
   - Peripherals (GPIO, Timers, ADC, DAC)
   - Communication interfaces

2. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
   - Task scheduling
   - Interrupt handling
   - Memory management
   - Device drivers

3. Communication Protocols
   - UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
   - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
   - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
   - CAN (Controller Area Network)

4. Development Tools
   - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
   - Debuggers and programmers
   - Oscilloscopes and logic analyzers
   - Protocol analyzers

5. Design Considerations
   - Power consumption
   - Real-time constraints
   - Reliability and safety
   - Cost optimization
   - Size and weight constraints

Common Applications:
- Automotive systems
- Medical devices
- Industrial automation
- Consumer electronics
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices
- Aerospace systems
